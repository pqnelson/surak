# Introduction

[Surak](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Surak) is a toy automated theorem prover, more for my learning how one works than actual use.

It's written in Haskell, and released under the MIT License.

# Versioning

For simplicity, the version number is going to be `x.y.z` where `x`
refers to the order of logic (0 for propositional logic, 1 for predicate
logic, 2 for second-order logic, etc.), `y` is the "major version", and
`z` is the "minor version".
